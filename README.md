# Query a Digital Music Store Database

## Introduction

SQL programming language is widely applicable in Operations, Marketing, and Finance Industries. Employees make decisions by utilizing SQL for managing their companies tons of data. In this  Udacity project, to ensure that students have mastered the main concepts taught throughout the SQL lessons, they are expected to write SQL queries to assist a digital music store with understanding the media in their store, their customers and employees and their invoice information. To do this, the students will use the Chinook Database, a Database that holds information about the digital music store.

## Goal

- Students will ask questions based on the data, then write a SQL query to pull the data needed to successfully answer these question.
- Use the pulled data to build a visual (bar chart, histogram, or another plot) that answers their questions.
- Finally, students will draw conclusions and write their observations in a report.



## Deployment
To deploy this project on your machine, the SQL queries I wrote are stored in the SQL_QUERIES.txt file. You will need access to the Chinook database in order to run the successfully run each query to see results as shown in the SQL_Project_Submission.pdf file.
